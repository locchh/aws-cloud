
RI Marketplace

EC2 Reserved Instance Marketplace allows you to sell your unused Standard RI to recoup your RI spend for RI you do not intend or cannot use.

    Reserved Instances can be sold after they have been active for at least 30 days and once AWS has received the upfront payment (if applicable).
    You must have a US bank account to sell Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
    There must be at least one month remaining in the term of the Reserved Instance you are listing.
    You will retain the pricing and capacity benefit of your reservation until it's sold and the transaction is complete.
    Your company name (and address upon request) will be shared with the buyer for tax purposes.
    A seller can set only the upfront price for a Reserved Instance. The usage price and other configuration (e.g., instance type, Availability Zone, platform) will remain the same as when the Reserved Instance was initially purchased.
    The term length will be rounded down to the nearest month. For example, a reservation with 9 months and 15 days remaining will appear as 9 months on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
    You can sell up to $20,000 in Reserved Instances per year. If you need to sell more Reserved Instances.
    Reserved Instances in the GovCloud region cannot be sold on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
