The Evolution of Computing​
Dedicated

    A physical server ​wholly utilized by a single customer​.
    You have to guess your capacity​
    You’ll overpay for an underutilized server ​
    You can’t vertical scale, you need a manual migration​
    Replacing a server is very difficult​
    You are limited by your Host Operating System​
    Multiple apps can result in conflicts in resource sharing​
    You have a ​guarantee of security, privacy, and full utility of underlying resources​

VMs

    You can run ​multiple Virtual Machines on one machine.​​
    ​Hypervisor​ is the software layer that lets you run the VMs​
    A physical server shared by multiple customers​
    You are to pay for a fraction of the server​
    You’ll overpay for an underutilized Virtual Machine ​
    You are limited by your Guest Operating System​
    Multiple apps on a single Virtual Machine can result in conflicts in resource sharing​
    Easy to export or import images for migration​
    Easy to Vertically or Horizontally scale​

Containers

    Virtual Machine running multiple containers​
    ​Docker Daemon​ is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple containers.​
    You can maximize the utilization of the available capacity which is more cost-effective​
    Your containers share the same underlying OS so containers are more efficient than multiple VMs​
    Multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to the same OS requirements and will not cause conflicts during resource sharing​

Functions

    Functions are managed VMs running managed containers.​
    Known as ​Serverless Compute​​
    You upload a piece of code, choose the amount of memory and duration. ​
    Only responsible for code and data, nothing else​
    Very cost-effective, only pay for the time code is running, VMs only run when there is code to be executed​
    Cold Starts is a side-effect of this setup​
