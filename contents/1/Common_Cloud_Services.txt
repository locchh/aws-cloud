Common Cloud Services

A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types of services.

The four most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) would be:

    Compute​ - Imagine having a virtual computer that​ can run applications, programs, and code.
    Networking​ - Imagine having a virtual network that allows you to define internet connections or network isolations
    Storage​- Imagine having a virtual hard drive that​ can store files
    Databases​ - Imagine a virtual database for storing and reporting data or a database for general-purpose web-application

    Note: - AWS has over 200+ cloud services

The term “Cloud Computing” can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has “compute” in the name.
