Hashing and Salting

What is hashing function?

A function that accepts arbitrary size value and maps it to a fixed-size data structure. Hashing can reduce the size of the store value.

Hashing is a one-way process and is deterministic

A deterministic function always returns the same output for the same input.

Hashing Passwords

Hashing functions are used to store passwords in the database so that a password does not reside in a plaintext format.

To authenticate a user, when a user inputs their password, it is hashed, and the hash is compared to the store hashed. If they match then the user has successfully logged in.

Popular hashing functions are MD5, SHA256, and Bcrypt

If an attacker knows what function you are using and stole your database, they could enumerate a dictionary of passwords to determine the password.

Salting Passwords

A salt is a random string not known to the attacker that the hash function accepts to mitigate the deterministic nature of hashing functions
