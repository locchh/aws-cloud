Digital Signatures and Signing

What is a digital signature?

A mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.

A Digital signature gives us tamper-evidence.

    Did someone mess (modify) the data?
    Is this data is not from the expected sender?

There are three algorithms for digital signatures:

    Key generation – generates a public and private key.
    Signing – the process of generating a digital signature with a private key and inputted message
    Signing verification – verify the authenticity of the message with a public key

SSH uses a public and private key to authorize remote access into a remote machine e.g. Virtual Machine. It is common to use RSA

ssh-keygen is a well-known command to generate a public and private key

What is Code Signing?

When you use a digital signature to ensure computer code has not been tampered
