
Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containers.

Originally created by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)

Kubernetes is commonly called K8s

    The 8 represent the remaining letters “ubernete”

The advantage of Kubernetes over Docker is the ability to run containers distributed across multiple VMs

A unique component of Kubernetes are Pods.

A pod is a group of one more containers with shared storage, network resources, and other shared settings.

Kubernetes is ideally for micro-service architectures where a company has tens to hundreds of services they need to manage
