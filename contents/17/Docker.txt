
Docker

Docker is a set of Platform as a Service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Docker was the earliest popularized open-source container platform.

When people think of containers, they think of Docker.

Docker CLI – CLI commands to download, upload, build run and debug containers

Dockerfile – a configuration file on how to provision a container

Docker Compose – is a tool and configuration file when working with multiple containers

Docker Swarm – An orchestration tool for managing deployed multi-containers architectures

Dockerhub – a public online repository for containers published by the community for download

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open governance structure for creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime. Docker established the OCI and it is now maintained by the Linux Foundation.

Docker has been losing favor with developers due to their handling of introducing a paid open-source model and alternatives like Podman are growing.
