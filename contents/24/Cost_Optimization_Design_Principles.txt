AWS Well-Architected - Design Principles

Cost Optimization Design Principles

Implement Cloud Financial Management:

Dedicate time and resources to build capability Cloud Financial Management and Cost Optimization tooling.

Adopt a consumption model

Pay only for the computing resources that you require and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements

Measure overall efficiency

Measure the business output of the workload and the costs associated with delivering it. Use this measure to know the gains you make from increasing output and reducing costs.

Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting

AWS does the heavy lifting of data center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers. It also removes the operational burden of managing operating systems and applications with managed services. This allows you to focus on your customers and business projects rather than on IT infrastructure.

Analyze and attribute expenditure

The cloud makes it easier to accurately identify the usage and cost of systems, which then allows transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload owners. This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs.
