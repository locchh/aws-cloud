Performance Efficiency Design Principles

Democratize advanced technologies:

Focus on product development rather than procurement, provisioning, and management of services. Take advantage of advanced technology specialized and optimized for your use-case with on-demand cloud services.

Go global in minutes

Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

Use serverless architectures:

Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. Removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.

Experiment more often:

With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.

Consider mechanical sympathy

Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.
