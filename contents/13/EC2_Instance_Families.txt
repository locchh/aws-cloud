What are Instance Families?

Instance families are different combinations of CPU, Memory, Storage and Networking capacity.

Instance families allow you to choose the appropriate combination of capacity to meet your application’s unique requirements.

Different instance families are different because of the varying hardware used to give them their unique properties.

Commonly instance families are called “Instance Types” but an instance type is a combination of size and family.
