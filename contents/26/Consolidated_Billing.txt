
Consolidated Billing

Consolidated Billing is a feature of AWS Organizations that allows you to pay for multiple AWS accounts with one bill.

For billing, AWS treats all the accounts in an organization as if they were one account.

You can designate one master account that pays the charges of all the other member accounts.

Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost!

Use Cost Explorer to visualize usage for consolidated billing

You can combine the usage across all accounts in the organization to share the volume pricing discounts
