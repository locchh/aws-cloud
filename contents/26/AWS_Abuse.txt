AWS Abuse

AWS Trust & Safety is a team that specifically deals with abuses occurring on the AWS platform for the following issues:

Spam

You are receiving unwanted emails from an AWS-owned IP address, or AWS resources are used to spam websites or forums.

Port scanning

Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are sending packets to multiple ports on your server. You also believe this is an attempt to discover unsecured ports.

Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are used to flood ports on your resources with packets. You also believe that this is an attempt to overwhelm or crash your server or the software running on your server.

Intrusion attempts:

Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are used to attempt to log in to your resources.

Hosting prohibited content:

You have evidence that AWS resources are used to host or distribute prohibited content, such as illegal content or copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holder.

Distributing malware

You have evidence that AWS resources are used to distribute software that was knowingly created to compromise or cause harm to computers or machines that it's installed on.
