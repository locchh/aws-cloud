
Zero Trust Model

The Zero Trust model operates on the principle of “trust no one, verify everything.”

Malicious actors being able to by-pass conventional access controls demonstrates traditional security measures are no longer sufficient

In the Zero Trust Model Identity becomes the primary security perimeter.

What is the Primary Security Perimeter?

The primary or new security perimeter defines the first line of defense and its security controls that protect a company’s cloud resources and assets

Network-Centric: (Old-Way)

traditional security-focused on firewalls and VPNs since there were few employees or workstations outside the office or they were in specific remote offices.

Identity-Centric: (New-Way)

Bring-your-own-device, remote workstations are much more common, we can’t trust if the employee is in a secure location, we have identity-based security controls like MFA, or providing provisional access based on the level of risk from where, when, and what a user wants to access.

Identity-Centric does not replace but augments Network-Centric Security
