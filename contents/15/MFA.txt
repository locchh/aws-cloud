What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

A security control where after you fill in your username/email and password you have to use a second device such as a phone to confirm that it's you logging in.

MFA protects against people who have stolen your password.

MFA is an option in most cloud providers and even social media websites such as Facebook.
